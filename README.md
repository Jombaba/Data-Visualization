# Data-Visualization
This is the third in the series of projects. Our purpose is to examine the ‘Credit Card Application’ (CAD) data set and present an interactive dashboard which will be useful for data science teams and more business oriented end-users.  In the first of the projects in this series, we successfully removed all the missing values in the data set. After that, we featured an investigative look at the data set where we were looking for unintended discoveries of characteristics in the data set.  Here, we develop a single-item dashboard which is based on the distribution of two of the sixteen variables of the data set. The two variables used in the plot were chosen arbitrarily.
